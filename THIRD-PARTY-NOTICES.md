# Third-party notices

The MinerGuy is proprietary software; its source code is not published. The game is distributed under its
end-user license (`LICENSE` in https://github.com/RaCzKoViC/The-MinerGuy, `LICENSE.txt` in the game folder). The official builds
(`TheMinerGuy-<version>-win-x64.zip` and `TheMinerGuySetup-<version>.exe`) also contain the
third-party components listed below. Each component remains under its own license; nothing
in the MinerGuy license restricts the rights those licenses give you.

Versions below are the ones used by release 1.31.0 (`src/MinerGuy/MinerGuy.csproj`,
`obj/project.assets.json` and the DLLs shipped in the release package).

The installer and uninstaller (`TheMinerGuySetup-*.exe`, `Uninstall.exe`) target the .NET
Framework 4.8 that ships with Windows; no part of .NET Framework is redistributed.

## OpenAL Soft and the GNU LGPL

OpenAL Soft 1.24.3 is licensed under the GNU Library General Public License version 2
"or (at your option) any later version" (see the license header of its source files). The
full text it ships with is in [licenses/OpenAL-Soft-COPYING.txt](licenses/OpenAL-Soft-COPYING.txt);
the GNU LGPL 2.1 text is in [licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt](licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt).

- The game uses OpenAL Soft only as the separate dynamic library `openal.dll`, loaded at run
  time; it is not statically linked into `MinerGuy.exe`.
- You may replace `openal.dll` with your own modified or newer compatible build of OpenAL Soft,
  and reverse engineer the game only as far as needed to debug such a modification.
- The unmodified library is used. Its complete source code for version 1.24.3 is available at
  https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/tree/1.24.3 (tag `1.24.3`); the Windows binary is built
  by https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame.Library.OpenAL (package 1.24.3.4, commit
  `4d08985956a3278adad0bd51486fc1b217b829d2`). If those links stop working, open an issue in
  https://github.com/RaCzKoViC/The-MinerGuy and the corresponding source will be provided.
